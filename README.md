=====
**This repository contains my personal dwm setup.**


All patches were hand patched using various sources and diffed in a queue. This means that to use a patch further down the queue, all patches before it must be applied or some hand patching may be required.


**todo:**
* Implement pango.
* Clean up systray.
* Clean up powerline_theme -> change colors?
* Remove unused functions and dependencies.
